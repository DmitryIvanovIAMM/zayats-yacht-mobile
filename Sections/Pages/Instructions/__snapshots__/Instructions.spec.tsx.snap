            will request documentation associated with the vessel to be transported. Customs procedures are to be strictly adhered to for each country of origin and destination.
            

            

            Customs paperwork must be timely filed with the authorized Allied Yacht Transport representative upon request. Without proper clearances in place, vessels will not be able to load or unload, resulting in significant fines from the country of origin, demurrage, or potential arrest of the vessel by authorities.
            

            

            Citizens of countries other than the United States aboard an Allied Yacht Transport ship as a rider arriving in or passing through the United States are required to hold a valid B1/B2 Visa. Without a B1/B2 Visa, riders will not be allowed on an Allied Yacht Transport ship.
            

            

            Copies of valid Visas and current passports will be requested by an Allied Yacht Transport representative prior to approval.
            

            

            Upon loading, the original will be securely held by the Master on board Allied Yacht Transport for the duration of the voyage.

            Weight of the vessel can sometimes require that quantities of fuel and water onboard the vessel be reduced as much as possible while maintaining enough onboard for getting to and from an Allied Yacht Transport ship.
            

            

            If the vessel to be loaded is of a significant weight, Allied Yacht Transport representatives will provide additional guidance.
            

            

            Flammable liquids such as fuel stowed in containers will not be allowed. Bilges should be empty and bilge pumps should be switched off. Sewage tanks should be empty and switched off.

            Prior to loading, everything on the vessel should be powered down with batteries unplugged and cables stored.

            Plug-in connections and specifications will be provided. If arrangements have been made in advance, Allied Yacht Transport can also provide water connections. Standard 2“ water connections are available on board and vessels are responsible for supplying their own hoses with multiple hoses sometimes required.

             riders must attend the orientation meeting on board the vessel prior to departure in order to familiarize themselves with safety protocols, procedures and ask any further questions of Allied Yacht Transport representatives and ship's crew before departure from port.
            

            

            Riders must be physically capable of boarding an Allied Yacht Transport ship from a tender and climb a rope ladder.
            

            

            After receiving instructions from an Allied Yacht Transport representatives or ship's crew member, riders can proceed to climb the ladder and board the ship.
